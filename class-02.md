## Headings

Html has 6 levels of headings (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6):

<h1> : is used for main headings.
  
<h2> : is used for subheadings. 
  
<h3> : is used If there are further sections under the subheadings
  
## Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening
<p> tag and closing </p> tag.

<br /> : add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph.

<hr /> : To create a break between themes.

<strong> : that its content has strong importance (bold).
  
<em> : element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence (italic).
  
## Bold

we can make characters appear bold, when surround the words with an opening
<b> tag and closing </b> tag.

## Italic

we can make characters appear italic, when surround the words with an opening
<i> tag and closing </i> tag.

## Superscript && Subscript

<sup> : is used to contain characters that should be superscript.

<sub> : is used to contain characters that should be subscript

## Semantic Markup

text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.

# CSS

allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear, and rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented, understand how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

## A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration:

Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.

Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled, and sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value.

## Using External CSS 

<link> : element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.

href : this specifies the path to the CSS file.

type : this attribute specifies the type of document being linked to.

rel : this specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.

## Using Internal CSS 

<style> : include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside it.
