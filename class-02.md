## Headings

Html has 6 levels of headings (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6):

<h1> : is used for main headings.
  
<h2> : is used for subheadings. 
  
<h3> : is used If there are further sections under the subheadings
  
## Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening
<p> tag and closing </p> tag.

<br /> : add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph.

<hr /> : To create a break between themes.

<strong> : that its content has strong importance (bold).
  
<em> : element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence (italic).
  
## Bold

we can make characters appear bold, when surround the words with an opening
<b> tag and closing </b> tag.

## Italic

we can make characters appear italic, when surround the words with an opening
<i> tag and closing </i> tag.

## Superscript && Subscript

<sup> : is used to contain characters that should be superscript.

<sub> : is used to contain characters that should be subscript

## Semantic Markup

text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.

# CSS

allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear, and rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented, understand how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

## A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration:

Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.

Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled, and sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value.

## Using External CSS 

<link> : element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.

href : this specifies the path to the CSS file.

type : this attribute specifies the type of document being linked to.

rel : this specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.

## Using Internal CSS 

<style> : include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside it.
  
# JAVASCRIPT

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

statement : Each individual instruction or step.

## COMMENTS 

They help make your code easier to read and understand, its to explain what your code does.

1) MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS 

you use when  write a comment that stretches over more than one line.

2) SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS 

 used for short descriptions of what the code is doing. 

## VARIABLE

temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job, is a good name for this
concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 

## DATA TYPES 

JavaScript distinguishes between 1)numbers, 2)strings, and true or false values known as 3)Booleans.

### RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 

1) The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). 

2) The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).

3) You cannot use keywords or reserved words.

4) All variables are case sensitive.

5) Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

6)If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. 

### ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values,
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable, It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

### EXPRESSIONS 

evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions, 1)EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE, 2)EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.

### OPERATORS 

they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values,  mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. 

# DECISIONS & LOOPS

## DECISIONS

are made that determine which lines of code should be run next. there are components:

1)evaluation of a condition.
2)conditional statement.

comparing one value in the script, the result will be boolean.

using compartion operators: you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a
true or false value.

USING LOGICAL AND 

The logical AND is used to see if the user's score is greater than or equal to the pass mark in both of the rounds of the test. 

USING LOGICAL OR & LOGICAL NOt

The user has passed both rounds, so the min Pass variable will hold the Boolean value of true. 

# if statement

evaluats a condition, if the condition evaluats to true, any statement in the subsequent code block are executed.

can used 3 types:

1)USING IF STATEMENTS 
2)USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
3)USING SWITCH STATEMENTS
