# Images

* A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

* If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

* To add an image into the page you need to use an (img) element.

* src: This tells the browser where it can find the image file.

* alt: This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

* title: You can also use the title attribute with the (img) element to provide additional information about the image. 

* height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

* width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## Where to Place Images in Your Code

1)before a paragraph:

The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

2)inside the start of a paragraph:

The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3)in the middle of a paragraph:

The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

### Aligning Images Horizontally

used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.

* align: allowing text to flow around its left-hand side.

* left: allowing text to flow around its right-hand side.

### Aligning Images Vertically

* top: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.

* middle: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.

* bottom: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.

### Three Rules for Creating Images

1)Save images in the right format: Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format.

2)Save images at the right size: You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.

3)Use the correct resolution: Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels, Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots.

### Image Formats

* JPEG: Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.

* GIF: Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

### Image Dimensions

* REDUCING IMAGE SIZE: You can reduce the size of images to create a smaller version of the image.

* INCREASING IMAGE SIZE: You can't increase the size of photos significantly without affecting the image quality.

* CHANGING SHAPE: Only some images can be cropped without losing valuable information (see next page).

### Cropping Images

When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information.

### Image Resolution

Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

### Vector Images

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent, Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

### Animated GIFs

show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

### Foreground Color (color)

* The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. 

specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

1)rgb values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

2)hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.

3)color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

### Background Color (background-color)

You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).

### Understanding Color

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

### Contrast

When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

* Low Contrast
* High Contrast
* Medium Contrast

### CSS3: Opacity (opacity, rgba)

CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements,
The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to
indicate opacity.

### CSS3: HSL Colors

CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

* Hue: is the colloquial idea of color.
* Saturation: is the amount of gray in a color.
* Lightness: is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color.

### CSS3: HSL & HSLA

The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.

individual values inside parentheses for:

* Hue: This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
* saturation: This is expressed as a percentage.
* lightness: This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.
* alpha: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0.
