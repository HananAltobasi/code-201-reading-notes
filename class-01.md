# Introduction

## The Structure of This Book

 In order to teach you about creating web pages, this book is divided into three sections:

1) HTML

We will spend the first chapter
looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages.

2) CSS

We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages.

3) Practical

We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites.

## How the Web Works:

In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

1- When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site

2-Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers.

3-The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested.

4-The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
