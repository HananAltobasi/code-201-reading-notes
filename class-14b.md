# data-saturated
* enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny.
* If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.
* groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people 
 working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

# Project Aristotle’s
* They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. 
* They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
* patterns:
  * groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams.
  * Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room.
  * Some groups sought strong managers.
 * They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ‘‘unwritten rule’’ or when they explained certain things as part of the ‘‘team’s culture.’’

# group norms
 * Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.
 * Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound.
 * the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.
 * In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. ‘‘Over the past century, 
   psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,’’ the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010.
   
# technology industry
 * the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.
 * data reigns supreme.
 * that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. 
  In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
 * Google, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best:
  figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.
 * And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important.
