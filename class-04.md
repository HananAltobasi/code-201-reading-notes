# Links

are the defining feature of the web, because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

are created using the <a> element, click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.
  
You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Directory Structure

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder,
Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

1)Structure

root folder: The top-level folder, contains all of the other files and folders for a website. 

2)Relationships

The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.

3)Homepages

 index.html: The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder).

## Relative URLs

 can be used when linking to pages within your own website, they provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

 ## Email Links
 
 mailto: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element.
  
 target: If you want a link to open in a new window.
 
  # Layout
  
how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.
  
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

Building Blocks: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box, This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Containing Elements: one block-level element sits inside another block-level element.

Controlling the Position of Elements: CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.

#  FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

 ## Declaring a function
 
 to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
 
 ## Calling a function
  
  execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
  
 ## ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
 
 Expressions produce a value,They can be used where values are expected. 
 
1)function declaration: creates a function that you can call later in your code.

2)function expression: If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression.

## IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 

This way of writing a function is used in several different situations. 
Often functions are used to ensure that the variable names do not conflict with each other (especially if the page uses more than one script). 

## VARIABLE SCOPE 

the variable's scope: If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function.

1)LOCAL VARIABLES: When a variable is created inside a function using the
var keyword, it can only be used in that function.

2)GLOBAL VARIABLES: If you create a variable outside of a function, then it
can be used anywhere within the script.

## HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK 

Global variables use more memory, The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only
remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed. 

# pair programming 

is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.

### there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: 

Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary.

Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea.

Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey.

Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:

### 1) Greater efficiency

Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer,
but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).

### 2)Engaged collaboration

When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone,
When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help.

### 3)Learning from fellow students

If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution,
If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.
 
### 4) Social skills

Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills,
As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

### 5)Job interview readiness

the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. 
Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

### 6)Work environment readiness

Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
