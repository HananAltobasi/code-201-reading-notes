# Boxes

### Box Dimensions (width, height)

By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents, you can use the height and
width properties.

### Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen.

min-width: property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser
window is narrow.

max-width: property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser
window is wide.

### Overflowing Content

The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger
than the box itself.

have two values:

1) hidden: This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in the box.

2) scroll: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.

#### Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
